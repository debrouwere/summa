CHANGELOG

0.2.0

  * Ported and beautified various stats-related code I had lying around from Python to CoffeeScript.
  * Added a `random` submodule, mimicking the functionality of Python's eponymous library.
  * Added lots of docstrings, Ã  la literate programming.

0.3.0

  * Extracted maths-related code into a separate library, aptly named `math`. Summa now relies
    on this external library.
